  When working on this codebase:

  1. ALWAYS read .ai/CONTEXT.md first for project overview
  2. Follow patterns in .ai/architecture/PATTERNS.md
  3. Check .ai/decisions/ for context on past decisions
  4. Implement specs exactly as written - no extras
  5. Write tests for all business logic

  Priority order when making decisions:
  1. Security > Correctness > Performance > Readability
